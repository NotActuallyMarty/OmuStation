  # Rule 10 - No Shuttlebombing or EORG

  Shuttlebombing, the act of bombing or signifigantly interfering with the evacuation shuttle, is not allowed, unless you have a very good in-character reason to do so.
  It's cheap, easy, boring as hell, and doesn't lead to any interesting stories.

  Additionally, EORG (End of Round Griefing) is also not allowed. Once the round-end screen appears, please stay in-character and continue to follow all the rules.
  - This does not include antagonists who are permitted to continue being antagonists at CentComm; though they should have an in-character reason to be causing chaos rather than being a murderhobo for the fun of it.
